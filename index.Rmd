## Plotly Example With ToothGrowth Dataset 

- Previously in the Coursera Data Science specialization an analysis was performed of the Guinea Pig tooth growth data set
- The interactive plotly graph on the following slide would assist in the exploratory data analysis stage
- The graph demonstrates the lack of difference between the two vitamin C delivery methods at high doseages

## Plotly Graph
```{r Graph, echo = FALSE}
plot_ly(data = ToothGrowth, y = ~len, x= ~dose, color = ~supp, type = "box")
```
